### Work Experience
Sep 2018 – Jul 2022 Data Analyst and Estimator, Sunrise Process Equipment Private Limited
Brought my expertise in data analysis & business intelligence to drive strategic decisions, to integrate data analytics 
within business strategy frameworks. Harnessed the power of data to uncover market opportunities, optimise customer 
engagement & streamline business processes.

### MSc Thesis & Academic Projects
Enhancing Decision-Making in IT and Manufacturing with Advanced Data Analytics (Thesis):
Utilised advanced data analytics to dissect customer inquiry datasets, employing clustering algorithms for segmentation 
and identifying inquiry cycle time as a key lever for sales conversion optimisation. Developed sophisticated Power BI 
visualisations to distil complex datasets into actionable insights, facilitating strategic sales targeting. This work 
illustrates the integration of predictive analytics and visualisation tools to advance sales prioritisation methodologies. 

Machine Learning for HR Attrition Analysis:
Applied machine learning techniques including Random Forest, Neural Networks, and K-Nearest Neighbours to a 
comprehensive HR dataset, achieving over 80% accuracy in predicting employee turnover. Used Power BI for dynamic 
dashboards, highlighting attrition risks and informing strategic HR interventions. Demonstrated a data-driven approach 
to identifying and addressing key factors influencing employee retention and enhancing organisational HR strategies. 

Optimisation of DNA Forensic Processing:
Conducted a scenario analysis using Simul8 to implement Rapid DNA technology, significantly reducing evidence 
processing time from 7.9 days to under 1 day in optimal conditions. Achieved a substantial ROI by modelling several
operational enhancements, including courier services and 24/7 operations, demonstrating cost-effective strategies to 
support faster criminal convictions. This project underscores the potential of operational adjustments and technology 
upgrades in forensic science for streamlined evidence processing. 

Caravan Customer Dataset Analysis: 
Employed a suite of analytical tools (SQL, RStudio, SPSS Modeler) for an in-depth analysis of a comprehensive caravan 
customer dataset, blending data pre-processing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modelling to unveil consumer 
behaviour insights. Developed machine learning models to forecast purchasing patterns, enabling targeted marketing 
and product development strategies. Showcased the capability to use data analytics for strategic business decisionmaking in a competitive market landscape. 

Supply Chain Logistics Enhancement through Predictive Modelling:
Used cutting-edge machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression) to analyse and optimise 
supply chain logistics, identifying cost-saving opportunities and enhancing operational efficiencies. Presented a 
predictive analytics framework for order segmentation and expense forecasting, contributing to superior budget 
management and competitive positioning. Highlighted the transformative potential of predictive analytics in redefining 
supply chain management practices for industry-leading performance. 

Predictive Customer Segmentation for Retail:
Analysed nearly 100,000 transactions across Istanbul shopping malls, applying advanced analytics to decode consumer 
behaviour and segment key demographic groups. Insights revealed actionable strategies for inventory diversification 
and customer-centric marketing, emphasising the importance of data-driven approaches in retail innovation. Positioned 
as a foundational study for future research, this project showcases the power of predictive analytics in shaping retail 
marketing strategies and customer engagement.
