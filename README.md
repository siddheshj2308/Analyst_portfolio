## MSc Thesis & Academic Projects
### MSc Thesis: Enhancing Decision-Making in IT and Manufacturing with Advanced Data Analytics
Utilised advanced data analytics to dissect customer inquiry datasets, employing clustering algorithms for segmentation 
and identifying inquiry cycle time as a key lever for sales conversion optimisation. Developed sophisticated Power BI 
visualisations to distil complex datasets into actionable insights, facilitating strategic sales targeting. This work 
illustrates the integration of predictive analytics and visualisation tools to advance sales prioritisation methodologies. 

### UK Road Safety Data Analysis:
Conducted a detailed analysis of UK road safety using SQL Server and Power BI, uncovering key trends in accident timings, jurisdictional and vehicle type variances, and high-risk factors like vehicle manoeuvres and driver demographics. Insights on older vehicles and motorcycles in fatal accidents informed strategic interventions. Results were distilled into actionable reports and visualisations for stakeholders, aiding in evidence-based road safety enhancements.

### Machine Learning for HR Attrition Analysis:
Applied machine learning techniques including Random Forest, Neural Networks, and K-Nearest Neighbours to a 
comprehensive HR dataset, achieving over 80% accuracy in predicting employee turnover. Used Power BI for dynamic 
dashboards, highlighting attrition risks and informing strategic HR interventions. Demonstrated a data-driven approach 
to identifying and addressing key factors influencing employee retention and enhancing organisational HR strategies. 

### Supply Chain Logistics Enhancement through Predictive Modelling:
Used cutting-edge machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression) to analyse and optimise 
supply chain logistics, identifying cost-saving opportunities and enhancing operational efficiencies. Presented a 
predictive analytics framework for order segmentation and expense forecasting, contributing to superior budget 
management and competitive positioning. Highlighted the transformative potential of predictive analytics in redefining 
supply chain management practices for industry-leading performance. 

### Predictive Customer Segmentation for Retail:
Analysed nearly 100,000 transactions across Istanbul shopping malls, applying advanced analytics to decode consumer 
behaviour and segment key demographic groups. Insights revealed actionable strategies for inventory diversification 
and customer-centric marketing, emphasising the importance of data-driven approaches in retail innovation. Positioned 
as a foundational study for future research, this project showcases the power of predictive analytics in shaping retail 
marketing strategies and customer engagement.
