### Work Experience


### Projects
1.	MSC Theis: Enhancing Decision-Making in IT and Manufacturing with Advanced Data Analytics
In my thesis, "Enhancing Decision-Making in IT and Manufacturing with Advanced Data Analytics," I delve into the transformative power of advanced data analytics in optimizing decision-making processes within the realms of both information technology (IT) and manufacturing sectors.
One significant aspect of my research involves leveraging advanced data analytics techniques to dissect intricate customer inquiry datasets. By employing cutting-edge clustering algorithms, I successfully segmented customer inquiries, enabling a nuanced understanding of customer behaviour and preferences. Notably, I identified inquiry cycle time as a pivotal factor influencing sales conversion rates, thus unveiling a key lever for sales conversion optimization.
Furthermore, I developed sophisticated Power BI visualizations to distil complex datasets into actionable insights. These visualizations not only provided stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of customer inquiry patterns but also facilitated strategic sales targeting by highlighting areas of opportunity and potential growth. Through the seamless integration of predictive analytics and visualization tools, my work showcases an innovative approach to enhancing sales prioritization methodologies.
Overall, my thesis exemplifies the intersection of data-driven insights and strategic decision-making processes in driving business success. By harnessing the power of advanced data analytics, organizations can gain a competitive edge in today's dynamic and rapidly evolving marketplace.

2. 2.	Machine Learning for HR Attrition Analysis

My HR analytics project, "Machine Learning for HR Attrition Analysis," epitomizes the synergy between cutting-edge machine learning techniques and strategic human resource management practices.

In this project, I harnessed the power of machine learning by applying various algorithms, including Random Forest, Neural Networks, and K-Nearest Neighbours, to a comprehensive HR dataset. Through meticulous analysis and model refinement, I achieved an impressive accuracy rate of over 80% in predicting employee turnover. This predictive capability empowers organizations with proactive insights into potential attrition risks, enabling them to take pre-emptive measures to retain valuable talent.

Furthermore, I leveraged the dynamic capabilities of Power BI to create interactive dashboards. These dashboards provide stakeholders with real-time visibility into attrition trends and highlight areas of concern, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic HR interventions. By presenting complex data in an accessible and actionable format, these visualizations empower HR professionals to identify and address key factors influencing employee retention effectively.

Overall, my HR analytics project underscores the importance of adopting a data-driven approach to HR management. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and visualization tools, organizations can gain deeper insights into employee behaviour and preferences, optimize retention strategies, and foster a more engaged and productive workforce.

3.	Supply Chain Logistics Enhancement through Predictive Modelling
My project, "Supply Chain Logistics Enhancement through Predictive Modelling," stands as a testament to the transformative impact of predictive analytics on supply chain management practices.
In this endeavour, I employed cutting-edge machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression to analyse and optimize supply chain logistics processes. Through rigorous data analysis and model development, I unearthed invaluable insights into cost-saving opportunities and operational inefficiencies within the supply chain ecosystem.
Central to the project was the creation of a predictive analytics framework designed for order segmentation and expense forecasting. By leveraging predictive modelling techniques, I facilitated superior budget management and enabled organizations to proactively identify and mitigate potential cost overruns. This framework not only enhances operational efficiencies but also contributes to a more agile and responsive supply chain, thereby bolstering competitive positioning in the market.
Moreover, my project underscores the transformative potential of predictive analytics in redefining traditional supply chain management paradigms. By harnessing the power of predictive modelling, organizations can anticipate future demands, optimize resource allocation, and streamline logistics operations, ultimately driving industry-leading performance and sustainable growth.
In summary, "Supply Chain Logistics Enhancement through Predictive Modelling" exemplifies the convergence of advanced analytics and supply chain management, paving the way for enhanced decision-making, cost savings, and operational excellence in today's dynamic business landscape.

4.	Predictive Customer Segmentation for Retail

My project, "Predictive Customer Segmentation for Retail," encapsulates the transformative potential of predictive analytics in revolutionizing retail marketing strategies and customer engagement.
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of nearly 100,000 transactions spanning various Istanbul shopping malls. Leveraging advanced analytics techniques, I decoded consumer behaviour patterns and segmented key demographic groups, uncovering invaluable insights into customer preferences and purchasing habits.
These insights served as a springboard for actionable strategies aimed at enhancing inventory diversification and fostering customer-centric marketing initiatives. By tailoring marketing efforts to specific demographic segments, organizations can effectively personalize the shopping experience, drive customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase sales revenue.
Furthermore, my project underscores the pivotal role of data-driven approaches in driving retail innovation. By harnessing the power of predictive analytics, retailers can gain a competitive edge in today's dynamic marketplace, anticipate consumer trends, and adapt their strategies accordingly.
Positioned as a foundational study for future research, "Predictive Customer Segmentation for Retail" highlights the significance of predictive analytics in shaping the future of retail. By embracing data-driven methodologies, organizations can unlock new opportunities for growth, establish deeper connections with their customer base, and pave the way for sustained success in the retail landscape.
