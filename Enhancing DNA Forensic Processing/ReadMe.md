### Enhancing DNA Forensic Processing
Conducted a scenario analysis using Simul8 to implement Rapid DNA technology, significantly reducing evidence processing time from 7.9 days to under 1 day in optimal conditions. Achieved a substantial ROI by modelling several operational enhancements, including courier services and 24/7 operations, demonstrating cost-effective strategies to support faster criminal convictions. This project underscores the potential of operational adjustments and technology upgrades in forensic science for streamlined evidence processing.
