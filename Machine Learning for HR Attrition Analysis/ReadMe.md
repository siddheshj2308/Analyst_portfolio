###	Machine Learning for HR Attrition Analysis

My HR analytics project, "Machine Learning for HR Attrition Analysis," epitomizes the synergy between cutting-edge machine learning techniques and strategic human resource management practices.

In this project, I harnessed the power of machine learning by applying various algorithms, including Random Forest, Neural Networks, and K-Nearest Neighbours, to a comprehensive HR dataset. Through meticulous analysis and model refinement, I achieved an impressive accuracy rate of over 80% in predicting employee turnover. This predictive capability empowers organizations with proactive insights into potential attrition risks, enabling them to take pre-emptive measures to retain valuable talent.

Furthermore, I leveraged the dynamic capabilities of Power BI to create interactive dashboards. These dashboards provide stakeholders with real-time visibility into attrition trends and highlight areas of concern, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic HR interventions. By presenting complex data in an accessible and actionable format, these visualizations empower HR professionals to identify and address key factors influencing employee retention effectively.

Overall, my HR analytics project underscores the importance of adopting a data-driven approach to HR management. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and visualization tools, organizations can gain deeper insights into employee behaviour and preferences, optimize retention strategies, and foster a more engaged and productive workforce.
