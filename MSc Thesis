MSc Theis: Enhancing Decision-Making in IT and Manufacturing with Advanced Data Analytics
In my thesis, "Enhancing Decision-Making in IT and Manufacturing with Advanced Data Analytics,"
I delve into the transformative power of advanced data analytics in optimizing decision-making
processes within the realms of both information technology (IT) and manufacturing sectors.
One significant aspect of my research involves leveraging advanced data analytics techniques 
to dissect intricate customer inquiry datasets. By employing cutting-edge clustering algorithms,
I successfully segmented customer inquiries, enabling a nuanced understanding of customer behaviour
and preferences. Notably, I identified inquiry cycle time as a pivotal factor influencing sales 
conversion rates, thus unveiling a key lever for sales conversion optimization.
Furthermore, I developed sophisticated Power BI visualizations to distil complex datasets into actionable insights.
These visualizations not only provided stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of customer inquiry patterns but 
also facilitated strategic sales targeting by highlighting areas of opportunity and potential growth. Through the seamless
integration of predictive analytics and visualization tools, my work showcases an innovative approach to enhancing sales prioritization methodologies.
Overall, my thesis exemplifies the intersection of data-driven insights and strategic decision-making processes in driving business success.
By harnessing the power of advanced data analytics, organizations can gain a competitive edge in today's dynamic and rapidly evolving marketplace.
