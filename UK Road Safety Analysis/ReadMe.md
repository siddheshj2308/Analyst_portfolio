# UK Road Safety Analysis

The project involved a comprehensive analysis of road safety data from the UK, utilizing Microsoft SQL Server for data processing and Power BI for visualization. The analysis focused on various dimensions of road accidents, including temporal patterns, police force jurisdictions, vehicle types, driver demographics, vehicle maneuvers, journey purposes, age of vehicles, and engine capacities.

Day of Week and Month Analysis:
The analysis revealed distinct patterns in accident occurrence by day of the week and month, indicating potential factors influencing accident rates such as traffic volumes and seasonal variations. This insight can inform targeted enforcement efforts and public awareness campaigns.

Police Force and Vehicle Type Analysis:
Variations in accident frequencies across different police force jurisdictions underscored the need for tailored road safety initiatives. Identifying the most common vehicle types involved in accidents, particularly cars in fatal accidents, highlighted the importance of vehicle safety measures and driver education programs.

Driver Demographics, Vehicle Maneuver, and Journey Purpose Analysis:
The disproportionate involvement of males in accidents and the identification of high-risk vehicle maneuvers and journey purposes enable targeted interventions to mitigate accident risks associated with these activities.

Age of Vehicle and Engine Capacity Analysis:
The overrepresentation of older vehicles and high-capacity motorcycles in fatal accidents suggests the need for vehicle maintenance, modernization efforts, and stricter regulations. Addressing these factors can contribute to reducing the severity and frequency of road accidents.

Implications for Road Safety Management:
The insights derived from the analysis can inform targeted interventions, infrastructure improvements, education campaigns, and regulatory measures aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of road accidents. By implementing evidence-based interventions, stakeholders can work towards creating safer and more sustainable transportation systems.

Overall, the project provided actionable insights that can significantly contribute to road safety management and policy development, ultimately leading to safer roads for all road users in the UK.
